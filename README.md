#TLDR

A comprehensive newsletter aggregation and analysis platform that processes tech newsletters, generates embeddings for semantic search, and provides an AI-powered chat interface for querying tech news content.

## Project Overview

TLDR is a full-stack application designed for software engineers and tech professionals who want to efficiently consume and interact with news from tech newsletters. The system automatically processes incoming newsletters, extracts articles, generates embeddings for semantic search, and provides both conversational AI interaction and manual browsing interfaces.

### Core Features

- **Automated Newsletter Processing**: Daily email processing of TLDR newsletter 
- **Intelligent Content Extraction**: HTML and text parsing to extract article titles, summaries, and source URLs
- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings using Xenova Transformers for enhanced content discovery
- **AI Chat Interface**: Claude Haiku-powered conversational interface for querying newsletter content
- **Manual Browsing**: Clean, chronological article browsing with filtering by newsletter source
- **Automated Cleanup**: 7-day TTL system with automatic cleanup of expired content

## Technology Stack

- **PostgreSQL** with PGVector extension for primary data storage and vector operations
- **OpenSearch** for advanced full-text search and analytics (local development)

### AI and Machine Learning
- **Xenova Transformers** for local embedding generation (384-dimensional vectors)
- **Claude 3 Haiku** via Anthropic API for conversational AI responses
- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model for semantic similarity and retrieval-augmented generation

### Email Processing
- **node-imap** for IMAP email server connectivity
- **mailparser** for parsing email content and attachments
- **Custom HTML/text parsers** for newsletter structure extraction

### Infrastructure and DevOps
- **Docker Compose** for local development environment
- **AWS CDK** for infrastructure as code (future cloud deployment)
- **node-cron** for scheduled task management
- **Environment-based configuration** for development and production settings

### Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL 16** as primary database with ACID compliance
- **PGVector extension** for native vector storage and similarity search
- **OpenSearch 2.11** as secondary search engine for complex queries
- **Automated indexing** pipeline from PostgreSQL to OpenSearch

## System Architecture

### Data Flow Pipeline

1. **Email Ingestion**: Scheduled IMAP connections retrieve newsletters
2. **Content Parsing**: Custom parsers extract articles from newsletter HTML/text
3. **Embedding Generation**: Xenova Transformers create vector embeddings for titles and summaries
4. **Database Storage**: Articles stored in PostgreSQL with vector data
5. **Search Indexing**: Content synchronized to OpenSearch for advanced search capabilities
6. **AI Integration**: Claude Haiku processes user queries with article context
7. **User Interface**: React frontend provides chat and browsing interfaces

### Search Architecture

The system implements a hybrid search approach:

- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity using cosine distance on embeddings
- **Full-text Search**: OpenSearch for complex text queries and filtering
- **Fallback Strategy**: PostgreSQL text search when OpenSearch unavailable
- **Relevance Ranking**: Combined scoring from multiple search methods

## Development Stages

- OpenSearch integration for enhanced search capabilities

### Phase 5: AI Chat Integration
**Completed**: Claude integration, RAG implementation, conversational interface

**Key Components**:
- Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku API integration
- Retrieval-augmented generation with article context
- Conversational AI interface with streaming responses
- Context building from relevant articles

### Phase 6: Automation and Scheduling
**Completed**: Automated processing, TTL management, production scheduling

**Key Components**:
- Daily newsletter processing at 10:00 AM EST
- Automatic cleanup of expired articles (7-day TTL)
- Cron-based scheduling with environment-specific behavior
- Manual trigger endpoints for testing and debugging

## Project Scope and Limitations

### Current Scope
- **Newsletter Sources**: TLDR newsletter family
- **Content Types**: Article titles, summaries, and source URLs
- **User Base**: Individual developers and small teams
- **Processing Volume**: Approximately 50-100 articles per day
- **Retention Period**: 7-day rolling window of content

### Technical Limitations
- **Local Development Focus**: Optimized for local development with manual cloud deployment
- **Single Email Account**: Processes newsletters from one configured email account
- **Basic Authentication**: Placeholder authentication system for development
- **Newsletter Format Dependency**: Parsing logic specific to newsletter structure

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Cloud deployment automation with AWS CDK
- Multi-user authentication and authorization
- Additional newsletter source integration
- Advanced analytics and usage metrics
- Mobile application development
- Enterprise features for larger teams

## Performance Characteristics

### Processing Metrics
- **Email Processing**: 5-10 seconds per newsletter
- **Embedding Generation**: 100-200ms per article
- **Search Response Time**: Under 500ms for most queries
- **Chat Response Time**: 1-3 seconds including AI processing
- **Database Query Performance**: Sub-100ms for typical article retrieval

### Resource Requirements
